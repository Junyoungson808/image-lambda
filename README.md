### Collaborator: [Stephen M.](https://github.com/SdMartinez13)

### Description:
    Successfully created a Lambda app on AWS and a bucket to test our Lambda app.

### Issues:
    I had issues with the onChange for a bit, I misnavigated and got lost and ended up deleted my app. Restarted and got back where I was and with Stephen's assistance and help I was able to figure out my problem and solve the issue.
